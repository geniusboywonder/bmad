# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BotArmy is an autonomous Product Generator that creates functional Proof-of-Concept (POC) web products through orchestrated AI agents. The system implements a sequential Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) with specialized agents (Analyst, Architect, Developer, Tester, Deployer) coordinated by a central Orchestrator. The platform enables dynamic team assembly, multi-domain problem-solving, and seamless human-agent collaboration via a real-time interface with configurable Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want an orchestrated system of specialized AI agents, so that I can automate the entire product development lifecycle from requirements to deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a new project THEN the system SHALL activate the Orchestrator agent to coordinate the SDLC workflow
2. WHEN the Orchestrator receives a project request THEN it SHALL sequentially activate Analyst, Architect, Developer, Tester, and Deployer agents
3. WHEN an agent completes its phase THEN the system SHALL pass structured context to the next agent using HandoffSchema
4. WHEN agents encounter conflicts THEN the Orchestrator SHALL attempt automated mediation up to 3 times before escalating to human arbitration
5. WHEN the workflow progresses THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent state and provide real-time status updates

### Requirement 2: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Control System

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want configurable oversight and approval mechanisms, so that I can maintain control over the development process while benefiting from automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each major SDLC phase completes THEN the system SHALL pause for human approval before proceeding
2. WHEN agent confidence falls below 80% THEN the system SHALL create a HITL request for human input
3. WHEN conflicts arise between agents THEN the system SHALL escalate to human arbitration with structured context
4. WHEN users configure oversight levels THEN the system SHALL support High, Medium, and Low supervision modes
5. WHEN HITL requests are created THEN the system SHALL support approve, reject, and amend actions with mandatory comments
6. WHEN HITL interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain complete history with timestamps and user attribution

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Communication and Status Updates

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want real-time visibility into agent activities and project progress, so that I can monitor the development process and respond to issues promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents change status THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates (idle, working, waiting_for_hitl, error) via WebSocket
2. WHEN tasks progress or complete THEN the system SHALL provide real-time notifications to connected clients
3. WHEN new context artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL notify users immediately
4. WHEN HITL requests require attention THEN the system SHALL send instant alerts to users
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast notifications with appropriate severity levels
6. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4: Context Store and Knowledge Management

**User Story:** As a system, I want persistent knowledge storage and retrieval, so that agents can build upon previous discoveries and maintain coherent problem-solving across interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents generate outputs THEN the system SHALL store them as structured context artifacts in the Context Store
2. WHEN new tasks are assigned THEN the Orchestrator SHALL inject relevant contexts to eliminate redundant discovery
3. WHEN artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL support mixed-granularity storage (document, section, and concept levels)
4. WHEN context is needed THEN the system SHALL provide sub-second retrieval times for up to 1000 artifacts per project
5. WHEN documents are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history with change tracking
6. WHEN artifacts are stored THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all content before persistence

### Requirement 5: Specialized Agent Behaviors

**User Story:** As a system, I want each agent to have specific expertise and responsibilities, so that the development process follows best practices and produces high-quality outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analyst agent is activated THEN it SHALL generate structured Product Requirements Documents (PRD) with user personas, business requirements, and feature maps
2. WHEN the Architect agent receives requirements THEN it SHALL create comprehensive technical architecture, API specifications, and implementation plans
3. WHEN the Developer agent receives specifications THEN it SHALL generate production-ready code with unit tests and proper error handling
4. WHEN the Tester agent receives code THEN it SHALL create comprehensive test plans and execute automated validation scenarios
5. WHEN the Deployer agent is activated THEN it SHALL handle deployment automation, environment configuration, and post-deployment validation
6. WHEN any agent encounters unresolvable issues THEN it SHALL escalate to the Orchestrator for task reassignment or human intervention

### Requirement 6: Multi-LLM Provider Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want support for multiple LLM providers, so that I can optimize agent performance and manage costs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini providers
2. WHEN agents are configured THEN each agent type SHALL be mappable to specific LLM providers based on their specialized needs
3. WHEN LLM APIs are called THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failures
4. WHEN LLM responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize content before storage
5. WHEN LLM usage occurs THEN the system SHALL track and log usage for cost monitoring and debugging
6. WHEN API keys are managed THEN the system SHALL support configurable key management via environment variables

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that temporary failures don't disrupt the entire development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent tasks fail THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s intervals)
2. WHEN automated retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL escalate to the Orchestrator for task reassignment
3. WHEN the Orchestrator cannot resolve failures THEN the system SHALL create HITL requests with failure context
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL preserve complete workflow state to enable resumption
5. WHEN tasks exceed 5 minutes of inactivity THEN the system SHALL timeout with automatic status updates
6. WHEN network interruptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with automatic reconnection

### Requirement 8: Document Generation and Assembly

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want comprehensive documentation generated throughout the development process, so that I have complete visibility into decisions, architecture, and implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each agent completes its phase THEN the system SHALL generate structured documents using predefined templates
2. WHEN documents are created THEN the system SHALL assemble them incrementally after each stage completion
3. WHEN templates are needed THEN the system SHALL load them dynamically from .bmad-core/templates/ directory
4. WHEN documents are requested THEN the system SHALL support export in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML)
5. WHEN document changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain version control with complete change tracking
6. WHEN final documents are needed THEN the Orchestrator SHALL combine all agent outputs into comprehensive deliverables

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want responsive performance and the ability to handle multiple projects, so that the platform can scale with organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL respond within 200ms for status queries and 500ms for task initiation
2. WHEN WebSocket events are sent THEN they SHALL be delivered within 100ms with HITL notifications appearing within 1 second
3. WHEN multiple projects run THEN the system SHALL support 10 concurrent projects with up to 50 simultaneous tasks each
4. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN the system SHALL support 100 concurrent connections with load balancing
5. WHEN long-running tasks execute THEN they SHALL provide progress updates every 30 seconds to prevent timeout
6. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use proper transactions with rollback capabilities on failure
