## 🔧 **Epic: Data & State Management - COMPLETED**

### Story: Audit Trail ✅

**Goal:** The system maintains a full, unalterable log of all project events.

#### ✅ Implementation Details:

**Database Schema:**
- New `event_log` table with comprehensive audit fields
- Foreign key relationships to projects, tasks, and HITL requests
- JSON payload storage for complete event context
- Performance-optimized indexes for query efficiency

**Audit Service (`app/services/audit_service.py`):**
- Following SOLID principles architecture
- Support for all event types (tasks, HITL, agents, system)
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking logging
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Structured logging integration

**API Endpoints (`app/api/audit.py`):**
- `GET /api/v1/audit/events` - Filtered event retrieval
- `GET /api/v1/audit/events/{event_id}` - Specific event lookup
- `GET /api/v1/audit/projects/{project_id}/events` - Project events
- `GET /api/v1/audit/tasks/{task_id}/events` - Task-specific events

**Event Types Captured:**
- Task lifecycle: `TASK_CREATED`, `TASK_STARTED`, `TASK_COMPLETED`, `TASK_FAILED`
- HITL interactions: `HITL_REQUEST_CREATED`, `HITL_RESPONSE`, `HITL_TIMEOUT`
- Agent status: `AGENT_STATUS_CHANGED`, `AGENT_ERROR`
- Project lifecycle: `PROJECT_CREATED`, `PROJECT_COMPLETED`
- System events: `SYSTEM_ERROR`, `SYSTEM_WARNING`

**Integration Points:**
- HITL response handler now logs all user interactions with full payloads
- Critical events like task failures captured with complete stack traces
- Metadata enrichment with timestamps, service versions, and context

  "version": "0.1.0",
  "checks": {
    "database": "pass|fail",
    "redis": "pass|fail",
    "celery": "pass|fail", 
    "audit_system": "pass|fail"
  },
  "health_percentage": 100.0,
