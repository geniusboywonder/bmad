# Task 4: Replace Agent Task Simulation with Real Processing

**Complexity:** 3
**Readiness:** 5
**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Goal

Replace the current placeholder agent task processing (time.sleep simulation) with real agent execution, database updates, and WebSocket event broadcasting.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/tasks/agent_tasks.py` (major refactor)
- `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` (update)
- `backend/app/websocket/manager.py` (enable real events)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_agent_tasks.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- Replace time.sleep simulation with actual agent processing
- Implement database task status updates (currently commented out)
- Enable real WebSocket event broadcasting (currently only logged)
- Integrate with agent framework, LLM service, and template system
- Maintain error handling and retry mechanisms

**Technical Notes:**

- Current process_agent_task function is just a simulation
- Database update code exists but is commented out
- WebSocket events are logged but not sent
- Need to integrate with all previous tasks' deliverables

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Real agent task processing with LLM integration
- Database task status updates throughout lifecycle
- Live WebSocket event broadcasting to connected clients
- Integration with Context Store for artifact creation
- Proper error handling with retry mechanisms

**Exclusions:**

- Advanced task scheduling optimization
- Task priority management
- Bulk task processing features

### Implementation Steps

1. Remove time.sleep simulation and placeholder comments
2. Integrate agent framework from Task 2 for real agent instantiation
3. Implement database task status updates (PENDING → WORKING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
4. Enable WebSocket manager to broadcast events to connected clients
5. Add Context Store integration for artifact creation and retrieval
6. Implement proper async/await patterns for LLM calls
7. Add comprehensive error handling with structured logging
8. Update retry mechanism to work with real agent failures
9. Add task progress reporting for long-running operations
10. **Test: End-to-end agent task execution**
    - **Setup:** Create project with Analyst task and WebSocket connection
    - **Action:** Submit task through API, monitor via WebSocket
    - **Expect:** Real agent processing, database updates, live events, context artifacts created

### Success Criteria

- Agent tasks execute real LLM-powered processing instead of simulation
- Database accurately tracks task status throughout lifecycle
- WebSocket clients receive real-time task progress updates
- Context artifacts are created and stored properly
- Error handling gracefully manages LLM API failures
- Retry mechanism works with actual agent processing
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core task processing replacement. Advanced orchestration features and workflow management will be handled in separate tasks.
