# Task 10: Implement Security and Access Control System

**Complexity:** 4
**Readiness:** 4
**Dependencies:** Task 9

### Goal

Implement comprehensive security measures including API key management, input validation, access control, and audit logging to meet security requirements and prepare for future authentication features.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/security/` (new directory)
- `backend/app/security/auth.py` (new)
- `backend/app/security/validation.py` (new)
- `backend/app/security/access_control.py` (new)
- `backend/app/middleware/security_middleware.py` (new)
- `backend/app/services/audit_service.py` (new)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_security.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_validation.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- Secure API key management for LLM providers
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs and LLM responses
- Role-based access control framework for future authentication
- Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions and system events
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

**Technical Notes:**

- Config already has security fields (SECRET_KEY, ALGORITHM)
- Need to prepare for future authentication without implementing it
- Must secure LLM API keys and prevent exposure
- Requires comprehensive input validation for security

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Secure API key management with environment variable validation
- Input validation and sanitization utilities
- Access control framework ready for future authentication
- Comprehensive audit logging service
- Security middleware for request validation

**Exclusions:**

- User authentication and session management (out of scope)
- Advanced threat detection
- Custom security policies

### Implementation Steps

1. Create secure API key management with validation and rotation support
2. Implement comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints
3. Add sanitization utilities for user inputs and LLM responses
4. Create access control framework with role-based permissions
5. Implement audit logging service with structured event tracking
6. Add security middleware for request validation and rate limiting
7. Create data encryption utilities for sensitive information
8. Implement secure configuration management
9. Add security headers and CORS configuration
10. Create security monitoring and alerting
11. **Test: Security validation**
    - **Setup:** Configure security settings, create test requests
    - **Action:** Test input validation, access control, audit logging
    - **Expect:** Malicious inputs blocked, actions logged, security headers present

### Success Criteria

- API keys securely managed without exposure risk
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Access control framework ready for future authentication
- Complete audit trail of all system activities
- Security middleware protects against common attacks
- Data encryption protects sensitive information
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core security infrastructure. User authentication and advanced threat detection will be handled in future iterations.
