### **Epic 3: Data & State Management**

**Goal:** This epic ensures that the project's state, data, and all artifacts generated by the agents are stored persistently, are easily accessible, and can be retrieved reliably. This is crucial for project continuity and meeting our non-functional requirements for reliability and maintainability.

#### **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

**Story 1: Context Persistence**

* **As an** agent, I need to read from the Context Store so that I can access previous outputs and artifacts.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an agent begins a new task, **when** the Orchestrator passes a list of `context_ids`, **then** the agent must be able to retrieve the corresponding `ContextArtifact` content from the persistent store.
  * **When** an agent generates a new output (e.g., a plan, code snippet, or document), **then** it must be able to persist this as a new `ContextArtifact` record in the database, with a clear `source_agent` and `artifact_type`.
  * **Given** a user restarts a project, **then** the Orchestrator must be able to retrieve all relevant `ContextArtifacts` to rebuild the agent's context.

**Story 2: Task State Persistence**

* **As an** Orchestrator, I need to persist the state of all tasks so that the system can recover from a crash without losing progress.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a new task is created, **when** it is enqueued to the Celery broker, **then** its `task_id` and initial `status` (`pending`) must be immediately saved to the database.
  * **When** a Celery worker starts processing a task, **then** it must update the task's status in the database to `working`.
  * **When** a task completes successfully or fails, **then** the worker must update the task's status to `completed` or `failed`, respectively, along with any relevant output or error messages.
  * **Given** the system crashes during a task, **when** it restarts, **then** the Orchestrator must be able to query the database to identify and resume any tasks that were left in a `working` state for too long.

**Story 3: Document Generation and Access**

* **As a** user, I want to be able to download the generated documentation so that I can share it with my team.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a key document is created as a `ContextArtifact` (e.g., the Software Specification), **when** the user clicks a "Download" link in the UI, **then** the system must serve the content as a PDF or Markdown file.
  * **When** the project is completed, **then** the final artifacts, including the generated code and the full project documentation, must be packaged and made available for a single download.
  * **Then** the download links should remain accessible even after the agent workflow has concluded.

**Story 4: Audit Trail**

* **As a** system administrator, I need a complete audit trail of all project events so that I can debug issues and review the process.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** any significant event occurs (e.g., a task state change, an agent handoff, or a HITL response), **when** the event is processed, **then** it must be logged to a centralized logging system.
  * **The** log entry must include a timestamp, the `task_id`, the `agent_type`, the event type, and any relevant payload.
  * **Given** a `HitlRequest` is amended, **then** the audit log must contain an entry detailing the original agent output, the user-provided amendment, and the timestamp of the change.
  * **When** a task fails, **then** the full stack trace and error message must be captured in the audit log.
