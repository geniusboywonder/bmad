# Task 2: Implement Agent Framework with AutoGen Integration

**Complexity:** 5
**Readiness:** 4
**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Goal

Create the core agent framework that integrates with AutoGen for conversation management and implements the six specialized agent types (Orchestrator, Analyst, Architect, Coder, Tester, Deployer).

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/agents/` (new directory)
- `backend/app/agents/base_agent.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/orchestrator.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/analyst.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/architect.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/coder.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/tester.py` (new)
- `backend/app/agents/deployer.py` (new)
- `backend/app/services/agent_service.py` (new)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_agents.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- AutoGen framework integration for conversation management
- Structured handoffs between agents using HandoffSchema
- Agent-specific prompt engineering and behavior
- Context artifact creation and consumption
- Integration with LLM service from Task 1

**Technical Notes:**

- AutoGen is already imported in orchestrator.py but not used
- Need to load agent configurations from .bmad-core/agents/ directory
- Follow existing model patterns for agent data structures

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Base agent class with common functionality
- Six specialized agent implementations with unique behaviors
- AutoGen conversation management integration
- Agent factory and service layer
- HandoffSchema implementation for structured communication

**Exclusions:**

- BMAD template system integration (separate task)
- Frontend agent status UI
- Advanced agent learning/adaptation features

### Implementation Steps

1. Create base agent class with LLM integration, context management, and logging
2. Implement AutoGen conversation wrapper for structured agent interactions
3. Create Orchestrator agent with workflow coordination capabilities
4. Implement Analyst agent with requirements analysis and PRD generation
5. Implement Architect agent with technical architecture and API specification
6. Implement Coder agent with code generation and testing capabilities
7. Implement Tester agent with test plan creation and validation
8. Implement Deployer agent with deployment automation and validation
9. Create agent service factory with type-based instantiation
10. Implement HandoffSchema for structured inter-agent communication
11. **Test: Agent conversation flow**
    - **Setup:** Create test project with Orchestrator and Analyst agents
    - **Action:** Execute handoff from Orchestrator to Analyst with context
    - **Expect:** Structured communication, context preservation, proper AutoGen integration

### Success Criteria

- All six agent types implement required behavioral specifications
- AutoGen framework manages agent conversations with proper context passing
- HandoffSchema enables structured communication between agents
- Agents create and consume context artifacts correctly
- Agent factory instantiates correct agent types based on configuration
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core agent framework and AutoGen integration. BMAD template system integration and workflow orchestration will be handled in separate tasks.
