### **Sprint 4: Validation & Finalization**

**Goal:** Ensure the system is robust, bug-free, and fully documented. This sprint focuses on quality assurance, performance, and preparing for launch.

---

#### **Epic: Data & State Management**

* **Story:** Audit Trail
  * **Goal:** The system maintains a full, unalterable log of all project events.
  * **Tasks:**
    * Implement the logging service to capture all events in the `event_log` table.
    * Ensure critical events like `hitl_response` and task failures are captured with their full payloads.

#### **Epic: Project Lifecycle & Orchestration**

* **Story:** End-to-End Testing
  * **Goal:** The entire workflow, from project initiation to final artifact generation, functions as expected.
  * **Tasks:**
    * Write and execute automated end-to-end tests to simulate a full project run.
    * Test the bug-fix loop for the `Tester` and `Coder` agents.
    * Perform performance testing on the WebSocket and API endpoints to ensure they meet the `NFR-01: Performance` requirement.

#### **Epic: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface**

* **Story:** Request History
  * **Goal:** A user can see a history of all HITL requests.
  * **Tasks:**
    * Implement the frontend logic to render past HITL requests from the `chatStore`.
    * Ensure the UI correctly displays the original agent output and any subsequent user amendments.

#### **Finalization Tasks (Spike)**

* **Health Check Endpoint:** Implement the `/healthz` endpoint to monitor all services.
* **Deployment Script:** Write a script to automate the deployment process.
* **Documentation:** Consolidate all the created documents into a final, comprehensive project file.
