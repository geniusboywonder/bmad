### ‚úÖ Epic: Project Lifecycle & Orchestration - Final Artifact Generation

**Goal**: The backend can detect project completion and automatically generate downloadable artifacts.

**Completed Tasks**:

  - Automatic artifact generation from project context
  - ZIP file creation with structured project files
  - Support for multiple artifact types (code, documentation, requirements)
  - Automatic README and project summary generation

- ‚úÖ **Artifact API** (`app/api/artifacts.py`)
  - `/api/v1/artifacts/{project_id}/generate` - Generate project artifacts
  - `/api/v1/artifacts/{project_id}/summary` - Get artifact summary
  - `/api/v1/artifacts/{project_id}/download` - Download artifact ZIP
  - `/api/v1/artifacts/{project_id}/artifacts` - Clean up artifacts
  - `/api/v1/artifacts/cleanup-old` - Admin cleanup endpoint

- ‚úÖ **Project Completion Detection** (`app/services/project_completion_service.py`)
  - Automatic project completion detection based on task status
  - Configurable completion criteria and indicators
  - Automatic artifact generation on completion
  - WebSocket notifications for completion events

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Project API** (`app/api/projects.py`)
  - `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/completion` - Get completion status
  - `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/check-completion` - Trigger completion check
  - `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/force-complete` - Force completion (admin)

### ‚úÖ Epic: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface - Enhanced WebSocket Integration

**Goal**: Real-time WebSocket updates for HITL requests and responses.

**Completed Tasks**:
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced HITL WebSocket Events**
  - Fixed HITL response event broadcasting in `/api/hitl.py`
  - Real-time notifications when HITL requests are responded to
  - Project-scoped event distribution for HITL updates

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### New Services Created

1. **AgentStatusService**
   - Manages real-time agent status with in-memory caching
   - Broadcasts status changes via WebSocket
   - Persists status to database
   - Thread-safe status updates

2. **ArtifactService** 
   - Generates structured project artifacts from context data
   - Creates downloadable ZIP files with proper organization
   - Handles artifact cleanup and lifecycle management
   - Supports multiple artifact types and formats

3. **ProjectCompletionService**
   - Detects project completion based on task analysis
   - Triggers automatic artifact generation
   - Emits completion events via WebSocket
   - Provides detailed completion metrics

### API Endpoints Added

**Agent Status Management**: 4 endpoints
**Artifact Management**: 5 endpoints  
**Project Completion**: 3 endpoints
**Total New Endpoints**: 12

### Database Integration

- Enhanced existing `AgentStatusDB` model usage
- Integrated with existing `ProjectDB`, `TaskDB`, and `ContextArtifactDB`
- Proper transaction management and error handling
- Database abstraction through service layer

### WebSocket Event Types Added

- `AGENT_STATUS_CHANGE` - Real-time agent status updates
- `ARTIFACT_CREATED` - Notification when artifacts are ready
- Enhanced `HITL_RESPONSE` - Proper WebSocket broadcasting
- Enhanced `WORKFLOW_EVENT` - Project completion notifications
