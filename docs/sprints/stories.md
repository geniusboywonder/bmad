### **1. Detailed Story & Acceptance Criteria Definition**

The current stories are high-level. We need to break them down into granular, actionable tasks with clear acceptance criteria. This ensures everyone on the team understands what "done" means for each piece of work.

**Example: Detailed Story for "Amending a HITL Request"**

* **Story:** As a user, I want to amend an agent's response to a HITL request so that I can correct or refine their work before they proceed.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a user is presented with an active HITL request, **when** the user clicks the "Amend" button, **then** a new input field should appear, pre-populated with the agent's response.
  * **Given** the user is in the "Amend" state, **when** the user edits the text and submits, **then** the system must update the `HitlRequest` status to `amended` and store the new user-provided content.
  * **Given** the request has been amended, **then** the Orchestrator must be notified to restart the agent's process with the new, amended context.
  * **Given** the `HitlRequest` history log must be updated to show the timestamp and content of the user's amendment.
  * **Given** an agent receives an amended request, **then** it must be able to parse the new content and resume its task without error.

### **Epic 1: Project Lifecycle & Orchestration**

#### **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

**Story 1: Project Initiation**

* **As a** user, I want to start a new project by providing a product idea so that the agents can begin their work.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a new user visits the application, **when** they enter a high-level product idea into the chat and submit it, **then** the system must create a new `Project` record in the database.
  * **When** the project is created, **then** the Orchestrator must immediately instantiate the first agent (`Analyst`) and pass the initial user input as a task.
  * **Then** the frontend must display a message confirming the project has started.

**Story 2: Sequential Task Handoff**

* **As an** Orchestrator, I need to manage the state of the project so that I can hand off tasks between agents in the correct order.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an agent completes a task, **when** it returns a success status to the Orchestrator, **then** the Orchestrator must update the task's status in the database.
  * **Then** the Orchestrator must check the `SDLC_Process_Flow` to identify the next agent in the sequence.
  * **When** the next agent is identified, **then** the Orchestrator must compose a new task using relevant context artifacts from the previous task's output.
  * **When** the new task is composed, **then** it must be submitted to the task queue for the next agent to pick up.

**Story 3: Real-time Status Updates**

* **As a** user, I want to see the real-time status of each agent so that I know what is happening with my project.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an agent begins a task, **when** it changes its status to `working`, **then** a real-time event must be sent via WebSocket to the frontend.
  * **Then** the frontend must update the status of that agent and the current task in the UI.
  * **Given** an agent encounters an error, **when** it reports the error to the Orchestrator, **then** a real-time event must be sent to the frontend with an `error` status and a message.
  * **When** an agent completes a task, **then** a final event must be sent, and the agent's status should return to `idle`.

**Story 4: Final Artifact Generation**

* **As a** user, I want the system to generate and provide the final project artifacts so that I can download and use them.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** all agents have completed their tasks, **when** the final agent (`Deployer`) reports a successful run, **then** the Orchestrator must trigger the final document generation process.
  * **Then** the system must make the final code and a PDF version of the Software Specification available for download via the frontend.
  * **Then** the frontend UI must show a "Project Complete" status and provide clear download links.

### **Epic 2: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface**

#### **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

**Story 1: Approval Request**

* **As a** user, I want to be prompted for approval when an agent finishes a key planning task so that I can provide feedback before they proceed.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an agent completes a task that requires human review, **when** it submits its output to the Orchestrator, **then** the Orchestrator must generate a new `HitlRequest` record in the database with the status `pending`.
  * **When** the `HitlRequest` is created, **then** the Orchestrator must send a real-time event via WebSocket to the frontend, notifying the user that a decision is needed.
  * **Then** the agent's status should change to `waiting_for_hitl` and its process should pause.

**Story 2: Response to a HITL Request**

* **As a** user, I want to approve, reject, or amend an agent's response so that I can guide the workflow.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a `HitlRequest` is displayed on the frontend, **when** the user selects `approve`, **then** a `POST` request must be sent to the `/api/hitl/{request_id}/respond` endpoint with the action `approve`.
  * **When** the user selects `reject`, **then** a `POST` request must be sent to the `/api/hitl/{request_id}/respond` endpoint with the action `reject`.
  * **When** the user selects `amend`, **then** the system must provide an input field to collect the user's edits, and a `POST` request must be sent to the `/api/hitl/{request_id}/respond` endpoint with the action `amend` and the new content.
  * **When** the request is submitted, **then** the backend must update the `HitlRequest` record with the chosen action and the user's response.

**Story 3: HITL State Management**

* **As an** Orchestrator, I need to know the outcome of a HITL request so that I can resume or modify the agent's workflow accordingly.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** the `HitlRequest` status changes to `approved`, **then** the Orchestrator must send a resume command to the agent, allowing it to proceed to the next step.
  * **Given** the `HitlRequest` status changes to `rejected`, **then** the Orchestrator must send a termination command to the agent and notify the user.
  * **Given** the `HitlRequest` status changes to `amended`, **then** the Orchestrator must take the new content from the `HitlRequest` record, update the relevant `ContextArtifact`, and re-assign the original task to the agent with the new information.
  * **Then** the Orchestrator must update the agent's status from `waiting_for_hitl` to `working`.

**Story 4: Request History**

* **As a** user, I want to see a history of all HITL requests and my responses so that I can review past decisions.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a project has multiple HITL requests, **when** the user scrolls up in the chat, **then** the frontend must display all past requests and the user's corresponding responses.
  * **Then** the user's response should be clearly labeled as `approved`, `rejected`, or `amended`, along with a timestamp.
  * **Given** a request was amended, **then** the history must show both the original agent output and the final user-amended content.

### **Epic 3: Data & State Management**

#### **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

**Story 1: Context Persistence**

* **As an** agent, I need to read from the Context Store so that I can access previous outputs and artifacts.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** an agent begins a new task, **when** the Orchestrator passes a list of `context_ids`, **then** the agent must be able to retrieve the corresponding `ContextArtifact` content from the persistent store.
  * **When** an agent generates a new output (e.g., a plan, code snippet, or document), **then** it must be able to persist this as a new `ContextArtifact` record in the database, with a clear `source_agent` and `artifact_type`.
  * **Given** a user restarts a project, **then** the Orchestrator must be able to retrieve all relevant `ContextArtifacts` to rebuild the agent's context.

**Story 2: Task State Persistence**

* **As an** Orchestrator, I need to persist the state of all tasks so that the system can recover from a crash without losing progress.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a new task is created, **when** it is enqueued to the Celery broker, **then** its `task_id` and initial `status` (`pending`) must be immediately saved to the database.
  * **When** a Celery worker starts processing a task, **then** it must update the task's status in the database to `working`.
  * **When** a task completes successfully or fails, **then** the worker must update the task's status to `completed` or `failed`, respectively, along with any relevant output or error messages.
  * **Given** the system crashes during a task, **when** it restarts, **then** the Orchestrator must be able to query the database to identify and resume any tasks that were left in a `working` state for too long.

**Story 3: Document Generation and Access**

* **As a** user, I want to be able to download the generated documentation so that I can share it with my team.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** a key document is created as a `ContextArtifact` (e.g., the Software Specification), **when** the user clicks a "Download" link in the UI, **then** the system must serve the content as a PDF or Markdown file.
  * **When** the project is completed, **then** the final artifacts, including the generated code and the full project documentation, must be packaged and made available for a single download.
  * **Then** the download links should remain accessible even after the agent workflow has concluded.

**Story 4: Audit Trail**

* **As a** system administrator, I need a complete audit trail of all project events so that I can debug issues and review the process.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * **Given** any significant event occurs (e.g., a task state change, an agent handoff, or a HITL response), **when** the event is processed, **then** it must be logged to a centralized logging system.
  * **The** log entry must include a timestamp, the `task_id`, the `agent_type`, the event type, and any relevant payload.
  * **Given** a `HitlRequest` is amended, **then** the audit log must contain an entry detailing the original agent output, the user-provided amendment, and the timestamp of the change.
  * **When** a task fails, **then** the full stack trace and error message must be captured in the audit log.
