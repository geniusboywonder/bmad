# Task 8: Implement Error Handling and Recovery System

**Complexity:** 3
**Readiness:** 5
**Dependencies:** Task 7

### Goal

Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms including automated retry logic, timeout management, data integrity protection, and graceful degradation capabilities.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/services/error_handler.py` (new)
- `backend/app/tasks/agent_tasks.py` (enhance error handling)
- `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` (add recovery mechanisms)
- `backend/app/utils/retry_utils.py` (new)
- `backend/app/middleware/error_middleware.py` (new)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_error_handling.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_retry_mechanisms.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- Automated retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s intervals)
- Orchestrator escalation after 3 failed attempts
- HITL intervention for unresolvable failures
- Workflow state preservation during error recovery
- Timeout management with progress reporting
- Data integrity protection with transaction rollback

**Technical Notes:**

- Current retry mechanism exists but needs enhancement
- Need to integrate with HITL system from Task 6
- Must preserve workflow state during recovery
- Requires proper transaction management for data integrity

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Comprehensive error handling service with categorized error types
- Enhanced retry mechanisms with intelligent backoff strategies
- Timeout management with progress reporting every 30 seconds
- Data integrity protection with automatic transaction rollback
- Graceful degradation for partial system failures
- Integration with HITL system for human intervention

**Exclusions:**

- Advanced error analytics and reporting
- Machine learning for error prediction
- Custom error recovery strategies

### Implementation Steps

1. Create error handler service with categorized error types and severity levels
2. Enhance agent task retry mechanism with intelligent exponential backoff
3. Implement Orchestrator escalation logic after 3 failed attempts
4. Add HITL intervention for unresolvable failures with context
5. Create timeout management with 5-minute task timeouts
6. Implement progress reporting every 30 seconds for long-running tasks
7. Add data integrity protection with transaction rollback on failure
8. Create graceful degradation mechanisms for partial system failures
9. Implement network resilience with automatic reconnection
10. Add comprehensive error logging with correlation IDs
11. **Test: Error recovery scenarios**
    - **Setup:** Create project, simulate various failure conditions
    - **Action:** Trigger LLM failures, timeouts, network issues
    - **Expect:** Proper retry sequences, escalation to HITL, state preservation, graceful recovery

### Success Criteria

- All error types handled with appropriate recovery strategies
- Retry mechanisms work with real LLM API failures
- Timeout management prevents hung tasks
- Data integrity maintained during all failure scenarios
- Workflow state preserved and recoverable
- HITL escalation provides clear failure context
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core error handling and recovery mechanisms. Advanced error analytics and custom recovery strategies will be handled in separate tasks.
