# Task 5: Implement Workflow Orchestration Engine

**Complexity:** 5
**Readiness:** 4
**Dependencies:** Task 4

### Goal

Create the workflow orchestration engine that executes BMAD Core workflows, manages agent handoffs, and implements the 6-phase SDLC process with proper state management.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` (major enhancement)
- `backend/app/services/workflow_engine.py` (new)
- `backend/app/models/workflow_state.py` (new)
- `backend/app/database/models.py` (add WorkflowStateDB)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_workflow_engine.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_orchestrator.py` (update)

**Key Requirements:**

- Execute BMAD Core workflows dynamically from YAML definitions
- Implement 6-phase SDLC workflow (Discovery, Plan, Design, Build, Validate, Launch)
- Manage agent handoffs with structured communication
- Maintain workflow state persistence and recovery
- Support conditional workflow routing and parallel task execution

**Technical Notes:**

- Current orchestrator has hardcoded SDLC_PROCESS_FLOW that needs to be dynamic
- Need to integrate with template system from Task 3
- Must support complex workflows like greenfield-fullstack.yaml
- Requires proper state management for workflow recovery

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Dynamic workflow execution engine using BMAD Core templates
- Enhanced orchestrator service with state management
- Workflow state persistence and recovery mechanisms
- Agent handoff coordination with context passing
- Conditional workflow routing and decision points

**Exclusions:**

- Workflow designer/editor UI
- Advanced workflow analytics
- Custom workflow creation tools

### Implementation Steps

1. Replace hardcoded SDLC_PROCESS_FLOW with dynamic workflow loading
2. Create workflow execution engine with state machine pattern
3. Implement workflow state persistence in database
4. Add agent handoff coordination with HandoffSchema validation
5. Create conditional workflow routing for decision points
6. Implement parallel task execution within workflow phases
7. Add workflow recovery mechanisms for interrupted executions
8. Integrate with template system for document generation coordination
9. Add workflow progress tracking and milestone reporting
10. **Test: Complete SDLC workflow execution**
    - **Setup:** Load greenfield-fullstack workflow, create test project
    - **Action:** Execute full workflow from Analyst through Deployer
    - **Expect:** All phases complete, proper handoffs, state persistence, context artifacts generated

### Success Criteria

- Workflow engine executes BMAD Core workflows dynamically
- All 6 SDLC phases coordinate properly with agent handoffs
- Workflow state persists and recovers from interruptions
- Conditional routing works for complex workflow decisions
- Parallel task execution improves workflow efficiency
- Context artifacts flow correctly between agents
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core workflow orchestration engine. HITL integration and advanced error recovery will be handled in separate tasks.
