  Current Implementation Status vs. Architecture Plan

  ✅ What's Been Implemented (Tasks 2 & 3):

  - Agent Framework (Task 2) - Phase 2 in architecture
  - BMAD Core Integration (Task 3) - Phase 2 in architecture

  ❌ What's Missing from Phase 1:

  - PostgreSQL Database Setup - Required for persistent state
  - Celery Task Queue - Required for async agent processing
  - Redis Cache/Broker - Required for Celery and caching
  - Database Migrations - Required for schema management
  - WebSocket Manager - Required for real-time updates

  Infrastructure Components Status

  ✅ Available Configuration:

  # docker-compose.yml exists with complete setup:
  - PostgreSQL (port 5432)
  - Redis (port 6379)
  - Celery Worker
  - Celery Flower (monitoring)
  - Backend with proper dependencies

  ✅ Dependencies Ready:

  # requirements.txt includes all needed components:
  - sqlalchemy==2.0.43
  - alembic==1.13.1
  - psycopg[binary]==3.2.10
  - redis==5.0.1
  - celery==5.3.4

  ❌ Missing Implementation Tasks:

  Phase 1 Infrastructure Tasks Not in Sprint Plan:

  Task 0: Database & Infrastructure Setup

  Should precede Tasks 2 & 3

  Missing Components:
  1. Database Models & Migrations
    - backend/app/database/models.py (SQLAlchemy models)
    - alembic/versions/*.py (migration scripts)
    - Database connection management
  2. Celery Task System
    - backend/app/tasks/celery_app.py (Celery configuration)
    - backend/app/tasks/agent_tasks.py (async task processing)
    - Task queue integration
  3. WebSocket Real-time System
    - backend/app/websocket/manager.py (WebSocket manager)
    - Real-time event broadcasting
    - Connection lifecycle management
  4. Context Store Database Integration
    - backend/app/services/context_store.py (database-backed)
    - Repository pattern implementation
    - Artifact persistence

  Sprint Task Mapping vs Architecture Phases

  Current Task Coverage:

  Architecture Phase 1 (Foundation): ❌ NOT COVERED
  ├── PostgreSQL Setup: Missing
  ├── Celery Queue: Missing
  ├── Redis Cache: Missing
  ├── WebSocket: Missing
  └── Database Models: Missing

  Architecture Phase 2 (Agents): ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  ├── Task 2: Agent Framework ✅
  └── Task 3: BMAD Core ✅

  Future Tasks Cover Later Phases:
  ├── Task 4: Real Processing (Phase 2/3)
  ├── Task 5: Workflow Engine (Phase 3)
  ├── Task 6: HITL System (Phase 3)
  ├── Task 7: Frontend (Phase 4)
  └── Task 11: Deployment (Phase 6)

  Immediate Resolution Recommendations

  Option 1: Create Missing Task 0 (Recommended)

  Create task0-Implement-Database-Infrastructure.md:

  # Task 0: Implement Database and Infrastructure Foundation

  **Dependencies:** None (Foundation task)
  **Complexity:** 4
  **Readiness:** 5

  ### Goal
  Implement core database, Celery, and WebSocket infrastructure required by the agent framework and BMAD Core
  integration.

  ### Key Deliverables:
  - PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy models
  - Alembic migrations setup
  - Celery task queue with Redis broker
  - WebSocket manager for real-time events
  - Context Store database implementation
  - Health check endpoints

  ### Success Criteria:
  - All tests pass with database connectivity
  - Celery workers process tasks successfully
  - WebSocket connections handle real-time updates
  - Context Store persists artifacts to database

  Option 2: Infrastructure Integration Sprint

  Create a focused sprint to implement the missing Phase 1 components before proceeding with Tasks 4-11.

  Option 3: Mock Implementation for Testing

  Temporarily implement in-memory mocks for PostgreSQL and Celery to unblock testing while planning proper
  infrastructure implementation.

  Test Failure Root Cause Analysis

  The test failures you're experiencing are exactly what the architecture predicted:

  # Tests failing because:
  1. No PostgreSQL connection → Database model tests fail
  2. No Celery broker → Async task tests fail
  3. No Redis cache → Caching tests fail
  4. No WebSocket manager → Real-time event tests fail

  The code architecture is correct, but the infrastructure foundation (Phase 1) was skipped.

  ---
  Recommended Action Plan

  Immediate (Next Sprint):

  1. Create Task 0: Database & Infrastructure Foundation
  2. Implement missing components from Phase 1
  3. Update test configuration to use infrastructure services
  4. Validate Tasks 2 & 3 work with real infrastructure

  Testing Strategy:

  # Update test configuration:
  @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
  def test_db():
      # Use test PostgreSQL instance
      return create_test_database()

  @pytest.fixture
  def celery_app():
      # Use test Celery configuration
      return create_test_celery_app()

  Architectural Assessment

  ✅ Tasks 2 & 3 are architecturally sound - they just need the foundation infrastructure❌ Phase 1 Foundation missing -
   this should have been implemented first✅ Docker configuration exists - infrastructure can be deployed immediately✅
  Dependencies ready - all required packages are available

  The implementation order should be:
  Task 0 (Infrastructure) → Task 2 (Agents) → Task 3 (BMAD Core) → Task 4+ (Features)

  Recommendation: Implement the missing Task 0 infrastructure components to resolve all test failures and enable the
  excellent Tasks 2 & 3 implementations to function properly.
