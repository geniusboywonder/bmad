# Sprint 2: Backend Core Logic & Agent Integration - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

## Overview
Sprint 2 focused on implementing the core backend services and integrating the multi-agent framework. All primary objectives have been successfully completed.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Sequential Task Handoff Implementation
- **✅ Orchestrator Service Enhanced**: Updated `OrchestratorService` to use structured workflows

**Key Files Modified/Created:**
- `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` - Enhanced with HandoffSchema integration
- `backend/app/models/handoff.py` - Already existed, now fully utilized

### 2. AutoGen Framework Integration
- **✅ AutoGen Service Created**: New `AutoGenService` class for managing multi-agent conversations
- **✅ Agent Specialization**: Implemented specialized agent types (Analyst, Architect, Coder, Tester, Deployer)
- **✅ Task Execution**: Full integration of AutoGen agents with the orchestrator workflow
- **✅ Context Management**: Proper context passing and agent conversation management

**Key Files Created:**
- `backend/app/services/autogen_service.py` - Complete AutoGen integration service

### 3. Context Persistence Implementation
- **✅ ContextStore Service**: Already implemented and fully functional
- **✅ Database Integration**: Complete integration with `context_artifacts` table
- **✅ Artifact Management**: Full CRUD operations for context artifacts
- **✅ Context Retrieval**: Proper context retrieval for agent tasks

**Key Files Confirmed:**
- `backend/app/services/context_store.py` - Already complete
- `backend/app/database/models.py` - Context artifacts table properly defined

### 4. HITL Response Handling
- **✅ HITL API Endpoint**: Complete implementation of `POST /api/v1/hitl/{request_id}/respond`
- **✅ Response Actions**: Full support for `approve`, `reject`, and `amend` actions
- **✅ Backend Logic**: Complete HITL processing with database updates and history tracking
- **✅ Workflow Control**: Orchestrator can check HITL status and resume/halt workflows accordingly
- **✅ WebSocket Events**: Real-time notifications for HITL requests and responses

**Key Files Modified/Created:**
- `backend/app/api/hitl.py` - Complete HITL API implementation
- `backend/app/websocket/events.py` - Added HITL event types
- `backend/app/api/dependencies.py` - Added database session dependency

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Core Services Structure
```
backend/app/services/
├── orchestrator.py          # ✅ Enhanced workflow orchestration
├── context_store.py         # ✅ Persistent memory management  
└── autogen_service.py       # ✅ Multi-agent framework integration
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/hitl/{request_id}/respond  # ✅ HITL response handling
GET  /api/v1/hitl/{request_id}          # ✅ HITL request details
GET  /api/v1/hitl/project/{project_id}/requests  # ✅ Project HITL history
```

### Database Models
- ✅ All required database models implemented
- ✅ Context artifacts table functional
- ✅ HITL requests with history tracking
- ✅ Task and project management tables

## 🔄 Workflow Implementation

### SDLC Process Flow Integration
The orchestrator now follows the complete SDLC process:

1. **Phase 0: Discovery & Planning** - ✅ Analyst with HITL checkpoint
2. **Phase 1: Plan** - ✅ Requirements analysis with HITL checkpoint  
3. **Phase 2: Design** - ✅ Architecture and implementation planning
4. **Phase 3: Build** - ✅ Code generation and refinement
5. **Phase 4: Validate** - ✅ Testing and bug fixes
6. **Phase 5: Launch** - ✅ Deployment and final checks

### HandoffSchema Usage
Each phase transition uses structured handoffs:
```python
HandoffSchema(
    from_agent=previous_agent,
    to_agent=target_agent,
    project_id=project_id,
    phase=current_phase,
    context_ids=[relevant_contexts],
    instructions=detailed_task_instructions,
    expected_outputs=expected_results
)
```

## 🤖 Agent Integration

### AutoGen Agents Implemented
- **Analyst Agent**: Requirements analysis and project planning
- **Architect Agent**: System design and technical architecture
- **Coder Agent**: Code generation and implementation
- **Tester Agent**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Deployer Agent**: Deployment and infrastructure

### Agent Communication
- ✅ Structured conversations using AutoGen framework
- ✅ Context injection from previous agents
- ✅ Specialized system messages per agent type
- ✅ Error handling and agent status management

## 🔄 HITL System Implementation

### Complete HITL Workflow
1. **Request Creation**: Orchestrator creates HITL requests at checkpoints
2. **User Notification**: WebSocket events notify frontend in real-time
3. **User Response**: Three actions supported (approve/reject/amend)
4. **Workflow Control**: Orchestrator resumes, halts, or modifies workflow
5. **History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all HITL interactions

### Response Actions
- **Approve**: ✅ Workflow continues to next phase
- **Reject**: ✅ Workflow halts with notification
- **Amend**: ✅ Content updated, workflow continues with amendments

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
- `autogen-agentchat==0.7.4` - Multi-agent framework
- All existing dependencies maintained

### Configuration
