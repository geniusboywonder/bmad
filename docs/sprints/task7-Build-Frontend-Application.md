# Task 7: Build Frontend Application with Real-time Chat Interface

**Complexity:** 4
**Readiness:** 3
**Dependencies:** Task 6

### Goal

Create the frontend application using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS with a real-time chat interface for user-agent interaction and live project status monitoring.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Create:**

- `frontend/` (new directory structure)
- `frontend/package.json` (Next.js project setup)
- `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectDashboard.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/AgentStatus.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (new)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (new)

**Tests to Create:**

- `frontend/src/__tests__/ChatInterface.test.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/__tests__/ProjectDashboard.test.tsx` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- Real-time chat interface for user-agent communication
- Live project status dashboard with agent status indicators
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- HITL request approval interface with approve/reject/amend actions
- Context artifact viewing and download capabilities
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Technical Notes:**

- Backend WebSocket endpoint exists at `/ws/{project_id}`
- API endpoints already defined in backend for projects, tasks, HITL
- Need to handle all WebSocket event types from requirements
- Must support real-time agent status updates

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Complete Next.js frontend application structure
- Real-time chat interface with message history
- Project dashboard with live agent status indicators
- HITL approval interface with action buttons and comment fields
- WebSocket integration for all real-time events
- Context artifact viewer with download functionality

**Exclusions:**

- Advanced UI animations and transitions
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Offline functionality
- Advanced accessibility features (basic compliance only)

### Implementation Steps

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Create WebSocket hook for real-time communication with backend
3. Implement API service layer for REST endpoint integration
4. Build chat interface component with message display and input
5. Create project dashboard with agent status indicators
6. Implement HITL approval interface with approve/reject/amend actions
7. Add context artifact viewer with download capabilities
8. Create real-time event handlers for all WebSocket event types
9. Add error handling and connection recovery for WebSocket
10. Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
11. **Test: End-to-end user interaction**
    - **Setup:** Start backend, create project, connect frontend
    - **Action:** Initiate workflow, interact via chat, approve HITL requests
    - **Expect:** Real-time updates, successful agent communication, HITL workflow completion

### Success Criteria

- Frontend connects to backend APIs and WebSocket successfully
- Chat interface enables real-time user-agent communication
- Project dashboard shows live agent status and task progress
- HITL approval interface handles all action types correctly
- Context artifacts display and download properly
- Real-time events update UI without page refresh
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core frontend functionality for MVP. Advanced features like analytics dashboard and workflow designer will be handled in separate tasks.
