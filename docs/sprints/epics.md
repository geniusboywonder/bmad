### **Project Epics**

This document provides a summary of the three core epics that form the foundation of the BotArmy Proof-of-Concept (POC) project. Each epic represents a major body of work, broken down into user stories that will be addressed in our development sprints.

### **Epic 1: Project Lifecycle & Orchestration** ðŸ”„

**Goal:** To establish the core workflow of the project, ensuring the system can manage the entire process from the initial user idea to the final product. This epic is the backbone of the entire system.

* **User Stories:**
  * **Project Initiation:** Start a new project by providing a product idea.
  * **Sequential Task Handoff:** The Orchestrator manages the handoff of tasks between agents in the correct order.
  * **Real-time Status Updates:** Users can see the real-time status of each agent.
  * **Final Artifact Generation:** The system generates and provides the final project artifacts for download.

### **Epic 2: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interface** ðŸ™‹

**Goal:** To build the critical interaction layer between the human user and the AI agents. This epic ensures the user has a clear and powerful way to provide feedback, approve progress, or amend agent outputs.

* **User Stories:**
  * **Approval Request:** Agents can pause and request approval from the user.
  * **Response to a HITL Request:** The user can approve, reject, or amend an agent's output.
  * **HITL State Management:** The Orchestrator can handle the outcomes of HITL requests and resume the workflow accordingly.
  * **Request History:** The user can review a history of all past HITL requests and their responses.

### **Epic 3: Data & State Management** ðŸ’¾

**Goal:** To ensure that all project data, state, and artifacts generated by the agents are stored persistently, are easily accessible, and can be retrieved reliably. This is crucial for project continuity, reliability, and auditability.

* **User Stories:**
  * **Context Persistence:** Agents can read and write from the persistent Context Store.
  * **Task State Persistence:** The system can recover from crashes without losing progress.
  * **Document Generation and Access:** Users can download final project documents and code.
  * **Audit Trail:** The system maintains a complete and unalterable log of all project events.
