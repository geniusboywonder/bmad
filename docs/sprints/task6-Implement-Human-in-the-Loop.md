# Task 6: Implement Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System

**Complexity:** 4
**Readiness:** 5
**Dependencies:** Task 5

### Goal

Implement the comprehensive HITL system with configurable trigger conditions, approve/reject/amend actions, history tracking, and integration with the workflow orchestration engine.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/services/hitl_service.py` (new)
- `backend/app/api/hitl.py` (enhance existing)
- `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` (add HITL integration)
- `backend/app/models/hitl.py` (enhance existing)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_hitl_service.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_hitl_api.py` (update)

**Key Requirements:**

- Configurable HITL trigger conditions (phase completion, quality thresholds, conflicts)
- Support for approve, reject, and amend actions with mandatory comments
- Complete history tracking with timestamps and user attribution
- Bulk approval operations for similar items
- Context-aware approval interfaces with artifact previews
- Integration with workflow engine for seamless pausing/resuming

**Technical Notes:**

- HITL models already exist but API endpoints are mock implementations
- Need to integrate with workflow orchestration from Task 5
- Must support configurable oversight levels per project
- Requires real-time notifications via WebSocket

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Complete HITL service implementation with all trigger conditions
- Enhanced API endpoints with real database operations
- History tracking and audit trail functionality
- Bulk operations for improved workflow efficiency
- Workflow integration for automatic pausing and resuming

**Exclusions:**

- Advanced HITL analytics dashboard
- Machine learning for approval prediction
- Custom approval workflow designer

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement HITL service with configurable trigger conditions
2. Add phase completion approval triggers to workflow engine
3. Implement quality threshold monitoring with agent confidence scoring
4. Create conflict detection and escalation mechanisms
5. Add user-configurable oversight levels (High, Medium, Low supervision)
6. Implement approve/reject/amend actions with comment validation
7. Create complete history tracking with audit trail
8. Add bulk approval operations for similar items
9. Integrate context-aware approval interfaces with artifact previews
10. Add HITL request expiration with configurable timeouts
11. **Test: HITL workflow integration**
    - **Setup:** Configure project with High supervision, start workflow
    - **Action:** Execute workflow phases, respond to HITL requests with different actions
    - **Expect:** Workflow pauses at trigger points, actions recorded, history tracked, workflow resumes correctly

### Success Criteria

- HITL system triggers at all configured conditions
- All three action types (approve/reject/amend) work correctly
- Complete history tracking maintains audit trail
- Bulk operations improve workflow efficiency
- Workflow integration pauses and resumes seamlessly
- Real-time notifications alert users to pending requests
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core HITL system functionality. Advanced features like approval analytics and custom workflows will be handled in separate tasks.
