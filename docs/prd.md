---

## 5. Key Features & Functionality

BotArmy includes the following key features:

- Configurable HITL control for workflows, artifacts, and agent behavior.
- Multiple focused agents with specific briefs and skill sets.
- Live agent status indicators (Idle, Thinking, Waiting, Error).
- A central Orchestrator that directs and manages task completion, agent communication, and the overall workflow.
- An interactive SDLC process with status indicators (Plan, Queue, WIP, Done, HITL).
- Real-time event streaming to the UI to inform users of progress, artifact generation, or blockers.
- A user interface (UI) that provides:
  - A process overview with real-time status updates for phases, tasks, and artifacts.
  - The ability to download generated artifacts.
  - A chat interface for engaging with the Orchestrator and agents.
  - Environment and settings management.

### 5.1 Multi-Agent Orchestration

- **SDLC Workflow**: The Orchestrator manages five agents sequentially: Analyst, Architect, Developer, Tester, and Deployer.
- **Handoffs**: Agents exchange structured documents using a generic JSON schema applicable to various processes or product creation with different agents.
- **Real-Time Task Monitoring**: A real-time resource subscription model enables clients to subscribe to task state changes, supporting monitoring without polling.
- **Push Notifications**: The system sends push notifications for task completion to keep users informed.

### 5.2 Orchestrator Role

The Orchestrator serves as the central coordinator. It does not directly modify code but:

- **Analyzes** tasks and breaks them into focused subtasks.
- **Dispatches** Analyst agents to understand the system.
- **Delegates** implementation work to agents with precise instructions.
- **Verifies** changes through additional Analyst agents.
- **Maintains** the context store with all discovered knowledge.

#### 5.2.1 Time-Conscious Orchestration

The Orchestrator prioritizes time-efficient execution by addressing inefficiencies in task specification. This includes:

- **Front-Loading Details**: The Orchestrator crafts precise task descriptions to avoid iterative refinements.
- **Context Completeness**: It provides comprehensive context to prevent subagents from rediscovering known information.
- **Explicit Expectations**: Each task specifies expected outputs, eliminating unfocused exploration.
- **Tight Scoping**: Defines clear boundaries—what to do and what not to do—to prevent scope creep.

#### 5.2.2 Agent-as-Tools Architecture

The architecture enables the Orchestrator to coordinate a team of specialized agents in parallel, maintaining context and delivering coherent responses by treating subagents as tools for specific tasks.

### 5.3 Shared Context & Persistent Memory

The platform includes a persistent knowledge layer that transforms isolated agent actions into coherent problem-solving through the Context Store Pattern, which enables:

- **Orchestrator-Directed Discovery**: The Orchestrator specifies required contexts for each subagent, ensuring focused and relevant information gathering and implementation reporting.
- **Knowledge Artifacts**: Subagents create discrete, reusable context items based on the Orchestrator’s requirements.
- **Persistent Memory**: Contexts persist across agent interactions, building comprehensive system understanding.
- **Selective Injection**: The Orchestrator injects relevant contexts into new tasks, eliminating redundant discovery and providing all necessary information for subagents.
- **Compound Intelligence**: Each action builds on previous discoveries, creating exponential problem-solving capability.

### 5.4 Document Creation & Expert Roles

The system follows a structured process to ensure quality and user alignment in document creation:

- **1. Product Definition**  
  The Analyst guides the definition of product vision and requirements.  
  - **Required Topics**: Product Vision, User Personas, Business Requirements, Feature Map, and Success Criteria.  
  - **Output**: A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).

- **2. UX/UI Design & Technical Architecture**  
  The Architect defines the user experience and technical implementation plans.  
  - **Required Topics**: UI Documentation, Feature Specifications, User Journeys, Interaction Patterns, Data Requirements, Technical Architecture, API Specifications, Implementation Tasks, Database Schema, and Testing Strategy.  
  - **Output**: A comprehensive Software Specification.

- **3. User-Initiated Generation**  
  If the user requests document generation, the Orchestrator verifies that all required topics are covered. If any are missing, it continues the conversation until complete.

- **4. AI-Determined Readiness**  
  Each expert agent tracks topic completion and does not proceed to the next topic until the current one is sufficiently defined.

- **5. Mandatory User Verification**  
  Before concluding their stage, each expert agent (Analyst, Architect, etc.) verifies with the user that all requirements are accurately captured. The agent requests permission to generate the final document only after user approval.

- **6. Document Storage & Assembly**  
  Each expert’s document is saved individually. Upon completion of all stages, the Orchestrator generates a single, comprehensive document combining all agent outputs.

### 5.5 Stateful Process Management

The system implements stateful process management, where tasks persist to disk with atomic writes, ensuring durability and recovery.

### 5.6 Event-Driven Architecture

The platform operates using an event-driven architecture, where components emit events consumed by subsystems, including the Logger, State Manager, Notifier, and Metrics.

### 5.7 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System

- **Core Mechanism**: The system provides configurable HITL control, allowing users to set oversight levels for the entire process, specific stages, or individual artifacts.
- **Intelligent Routing**: A smart notification system offers one-click resolution for background tasks.
- **UI Integration**: HITL requests appear as inline approval interfaces in the chat and as badges in the process summary, with navigation to relevant context.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The system detects conflicts and escalates to the Human Product Owner with structured context after a maximum of three negotiation attempts.
