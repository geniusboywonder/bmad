# Task 1: Implement LLM Provider Integration System

**Complexity:** 4
**Readiness:** 5
**Dependencies:** None

### Goal

Create a unified LLM provider integration system that supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini with configurable agent-to-LLM mapping.

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/services/llm_service.py` (new)
- `backend/app/config.py` (update)
- `backend/app/models/llm.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- Support multiple LLM providers with API key configuration
- Agent-specific LLM provider mapping via environment variables
- Response validation and sanitization
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Usage tracking and cost monitoring

**Technical Notes:**

- Config already has API key fields for all three providers
- Need to implement provider abstraction layer
- Follow existing structured logging patterns

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- LLM service abstraction layer with provider implementations
- Configuration system for agent-to-LLM mapping
- Response validation and sanitization utilities
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Usage tracking and logging infrastructure

**Exclusions:**

- Agent-specific prompt engineering (handled by agent implementations)
- Frontend LLM provider selection UI
- Advanced cost optimization features

### Implementation Steps

1. Create LLM provider abstraction interface with common methods (generate, validate, track_usage)
2. Implement OpenAI provider class with GPT-4 integration
3. Implement Anthropic provider class with Claude integration
4. Implement Google provider class with Gemini integration
5. Create LLM service factory with agent-to-provider mapping
6. Add response validation and sanitization utilities
7. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s intervals)
8. Add usage tracking with structured logging
9. **Test: LLM provider switching**
   - **Setup:** Configure different agents to use different providers
   - **Action:** Send test requests through each agent type
   - **Expect:** Correct provider used, responses validated, usage tracked

### Success Criteria

- All three LLM providers integrate successfully with unified interface
- Agent-to-LLM mapping configurable via environment variables
- Response validation prevents malformed content from reaching Context Store
- Retry mechanism handles API failures gracefully
- Usage tracking provides cost monitoring data
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the LLM integration infrastructure. Agent-specific logic and prompt engineering will be handled in separate tasks.
