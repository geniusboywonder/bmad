## [2.8.0] - 2025-10-02

### ‚ú® Feature - Dynamic Workflow Deliverables & Agile Alignment

**Backend Workflow Restructuring**
- **New Production Workflow Location**: `backend/app/workflows/greenfield-fullstack.yaml`
- **Deprecated Reference Location**: `.bmad-core/workflows/` (reference only - DO NOT USE)
- **17 Streamlined Artifacts**: Reduced from 30+ to 17 focused SDLC deliverables aligned with Agile methodology
- **5 HITL-Required Plans**: Each SDLC stage (Analyze, Design, Build, Validate, Launch) starts with mandatory human-approved plan

**Frontend Integration**
- **New Workflows Service**: `frontend/lib/services/api/workflows.service.ts`
- **Dynamic Loading**: Deliverables fetched from `/api/v1/workflows/greenfield-fullstack/deliverables` on component mount
- **API Integration**: `frontend/lib/services/api/index.ts` exports workflow types and service
- **Process Summary Enhancement**: `project-process-summary.tsx` loads artifacts from API instead of hardcoded constants

**API Enhancements**
- **Workflow Service**: `backend/app/services/workflow_service.py` reads from `app/workflows/` directory
- **Optional Agent Fields**: WorkflowStep model supports non-agent workflow steps
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing validate_sequence method and None agents

**Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Agile Alignment**: Artifacts match modern Agile/Scrum methodology (Epic ‚Üí Story ‚Üí Implementation)
- ‚úÖ **HITL Control**: Each stage requires human approval before proceeding with work artifacts
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth in backend YAML configuration
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Easy to add/remove artifacts by editing YAML file
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces generated from backend workflow definitions

**Files Changed**
- `backend/app/workflows/greenfield-fullstack.yaml` - New production workflow with 17 artifacts
- `backend/app/api/workflows.py` - Updated path from `.bmad-core/workflows` to `app/workflows`
- `backend/app/models/workflow.py` - Made agent field optional
- `backend/app/utils/yaml_parser.py` - Optional agent handling
- `backend/app/services/workflow_service.py` - Added hasattr check for validate_sequence
- `frontend/lib/services/api/workflows.service.ts` - New service for workflow deliverables
- `frontend/lib/services/api/index.ts` - Exported workflow service and types
- `frontend/components/projects/project-process-summary.tsx` - Dynamic deliverable loading
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` - Updated workflow and artifact documentation
- `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Added workflows directory and service references

### üêõ Fix - Chat Window Scrolling Behavior

**Problem**
- Chat window expanded vertically as HITL messages were added
- Messages pushed content off screen requiring page scroll
- Poor UX for monitoring multiple HITL approval requests

**Solution**
- **Fixed Container Height**: Replaced ScrollArea with native `overflow-y-auto` div
- **Flex Layout**: Added `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0` to messages container
- **Flex Shrink Prevention**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to header, agent filter, and chat input
- **Proper Scrolling**: Messages now scroll within fixed-height container

**Technical Implementation**
- **File**: `frontend/components/chat/copilot-chat.tsx` (lines 237-321)
- **Container**: Changed from `<ScrollArea className="flex-1">` to `<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0">`
- **Header/Footer**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression
- **Main Container**: Conditional `h-full` only when not expanded

**Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Height**: Chat window maintains consistent size
- ‚úÖ **Internal Scrolling**: Messages scroll up within container
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: No page scroll needed to see new messages
- ‚úÖ **Predictable Layout**: Chat window doesn't expand unexpectedly

**Files Changed**
- `frontend/components/chat/copilot-chat.tsx` - Fixed scrolling behavior
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` - Documented chat scrolling fix
- `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Updated chat component description

## [2.7.1] - 2025-10-02

### üêõ Critical Fix - Celery Worker Database Connection

**Root Cause**
- **Issue**: Celery workers were not connecting to PostgreSQL database
- **Symptom**: HITL approval requests created in database but not visible in frontend
- **Cause**: Celery worker started without `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Impact**: HITL approval workflow completely broken - approvals stored but never retrieved

**Technical Details**
- **Problem**: Starting Celery with only `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` overrides .env file
- **Missing Variable**: `DATABASE_URL` required by `get_session()` in `agent_tasks.py`
- **Result**: Celery worker couldn't connect to PostgreSQL for HITL approval records

**Fix Implementation**
1. **Updated CLAUDE.md** (line 15-20): Added `source .env &&` before Celery command
2. **Updated start_dev.sh** (lines 128-140): Added automatic .env sourcing with `set -a` pattern
3. **Added Documentation**: Clear comments explaining DATABASE_URL requirement

**Files Changed**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Fixed Celery startup command documentation
- `backend/scripts/start_dev.sh` - Added .env loading before Celery worker startup
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - This entry

**Testing**
- ‚úÖ Verified Celery worker connects to PostgreSQL successfully
- ‚úÖ Confirmed HITL approval records created in database
- ‚úÖ Validated WebSocket events broadcast correctly
- ‚úÖ Tested HITL alerts display in frontend

**Prevention**
- Startup script now automatically loads all environment variables before starting Celery
- Documentation updated with clear warnings about DATABASE_URL requirement
- Added comments explaining why each environment variable is needed

## [2.7.0] - 2025-10-01

### üêõ Critical Fix - HITL Duplicate Message Prevention

**Backend Workflow Optimization**
- **Fixed duplicate HITL approval creation** in Celery task processing workflow
- **Removed redundant RESPONSE_APPROVAL** creation that caused second HITL message for same task
- **Added existing approval check** before creating new PRE_EXECUTION approval records
- **Streamlined approval workflow** to use single approval per task instead of two

**Technical Implementation**
- **File**: `backend/app/tasks/agent_tasks.py` (lines 198-321)
- **Fix 1**: Check for existing PENDING/APPROVED approval before creating new record
- **Fix 2**: Skip RESPONSE_APPROVAL creation - pre-execution approval is sufficient for simple tasks
- **Result**: One approval per task eliminates duplicate HITL messages in chat

**Root Cause Analysis**
- **Previous behavior**: Backend created TWO approval records per task:
  1. PRE_EXECUTION approval (before task execution) - creates first HITL message
  2. RESPONSE_APPROVAL (after task execution) - creates second HITL message for same task
- **Issue**: Same task appeared twice in chat with different approval IDs but same task ID
- **Impact**: User confusion, cluttered UI, duplicate approval requests

**Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Clean UI**: Only one HITL message per task appears in chat
- ‚úÖ **No Duplicates**: Approval/rejection doesn't trigger second message
- ‚úÖ **Proper Workflow**: Pre-execution approval sufficient for task authorization
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Clear one-to-one relationship between tasks and approval requests
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Reduced database writes and WebSocket events

**Implementation Details**
```python
# Check if approval already exists for this task
existing_approval = db.query(HitlAgentApprovalDB).filter(
    HitlAgentApprovalDB.task_id == task_uuid,
    HitlAgentApprovalDB.status.in_(["PENDING", "APPROVED"])
).first()

if existing_approval:
    logger.info("Using existing HITL approval record")
    approval_id = existing_approval.id
else:
    # Create new PRE_EXECUTION approval
    # ...

# Skip RESPONSE_APPROVAL creation - would create duplicate
logger.info("Skipping response approval - using pre-execution approval only")
```

**Testing Validation**
- ‚úÖ Verified single HITL message creation per task
- ‚úÖ Confirmed approval/rejection doesn't create duplicate
- ‚úÖ Tested message persistence with status updates
- ‚úÖ Validated no stale approval IDs after approval
