# Task 9: Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring

**Complexity:** 3
**Readiness:** 4
**Dependencies:** Task 8

### Goal

Implement performance optimization features and comprehensive monitoring to meet the specified performance requirements (200ms API responses, 100ms WebSocket events, 10 concurrent projects).

### Implementation Context

**Files to Modify:**

- `backend/app/middleware/performance_middleware.py` (new)
- `backend/app/services/monitoring_service.py` (new)
- `backend/app/utils/metrics_collector.py` (new)
- `backend/app/api/monitoring.py` (new)
- `backend/app/services/context_store.py` (optimize)

**Tests to Update:**

- `backend/tests/test_performance.py` (new)
- `backend/tests/test_monitoring.py` (new)

**Key Requirements:**

- API response times within 200ms for status queries, 500ms for task operations
- WebSocket event delivery within 100ms
- Support for 10 concurrent projects with 50 tasks each
- Context Store performance with sub-second retrieval
- Comprehensive health monitoring and metrics collection

**Technical Notes:**

- Current health endpoints exist but need enhancement
- Context Store may need optimization for large artifact sets
- WebSocket manager needs performance tuning for 100 connections
- Database queries may need indexing optimization

### Scope Definition

**Deliverables:**

- Performance middleware for request/response timing
- Monitoring service with health checks and metrics
- Optimized Context Store with efficient indexing
- Enhanced WebSocket manager for high-concurrency
- Comprehensive metrics collection and exposure

**Exclusions:**

- Advanced performance analytics dashboard
- Automated scaling mechanisms
- Custom performance tuning tools

### Implementation Steps

1. Create performance middleware to track API response times
2. Implement monitoring service with comprehensive health checks
3. Add metrics collection for all critical system components
4. Optimize Context Store queries with proper database indexing
5. Enhance WebSocket manager for 100 concurrent connections
6. Add connection pooling and resource management
7. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
8. Create performance monitoring endpoints with detailed metrics
9. Add alerting mechanisms for performance threshold breaches
10. Optimize database queries with proper indexing and query optimization
11. **Test: Performance benchmarks**
    - **Setup:** Create 10 concurrent projects with 50 tasks each
    - **Action:** Execute workflows, measure response times, monitor resource usage
    - **Expect:** All performance requirements met, system stable under load

### Success Criteria

- API endpoints respond within specified time limits
- WebSocket events deliver within 100ms consistently
- System supports 10 concurrent projects without degradation
- Context Store retrieval completes within 200ms
- Health monitoring provides comprehensive system visibility
- Performance metrics expose all critical measurements
- All tests pass

### Scope Constraint

Implement only the core performance optimization and monitoring features. Advanced analytics and automated scaling will be handled in separate tasks.
