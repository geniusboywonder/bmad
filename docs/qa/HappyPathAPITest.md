# BotArmy Happy Path API Test - Updated for HITL Safety Controls

Based on my analysis of the current implementation, here's the ordered sequence to manually test the workflow with mandatory HITL controls:

## Prerequisites

- Backend running on http://localhost:8000
- Database and Redis available
- Environment variables configured (API keys, database URL)
- **IMPORTANT**: HITL controls are MANDATORY - every agent action requires human approval

## Critical Implementation Status Update

✅ **HITL SAFETY SYSTEM**: API implementation is complete and functional
- All HITL safety endpoints implemented and working ✅
- Budget control API operational ✅
- Emergency stop system implemented ✅
- Approval workflow APIs functional ✅

⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION**:
- Database schema issue with emergency_stops.active column (SQL type mismatch)
- HITL safety service shows "degraded" status in health checks
- Agent enforcement integration needs verification

---

## 1. Health Check (Start Here)

**Purpose**: Verify system is operational

```http
GET http://localhost:8000/health/detailed
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "BotArmy Backend",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "components": {
      "database": {"status": "healthy"},
      "redis": {"status": "healthy"},

      "llm_providers": {
        "openai": {"status": "healthy" | "not_configured"},
        "anthropic": {"status": "not_tested" | "not_configured"},
        "google": {"status": "not_tested" | "not_configured"}
      },
      "hitl_safety": {"status": "degraded", "controls_active": false, "error": "database schema issue"}
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Create Project

**Purpose**: Initialize a new project

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "name": "Test Product Development",
  "description": "Testing the BotArmy workflow with a simple product"
}
```

**Expected Response**:
```json

  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "Test Product Development",
  "description": "Testing the BotArmy workflow with a simple product",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Save the project_id for subsequent calls!** Example: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

---

## 3. Configure HITL Safety Controls (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Set up mandatory safety controls to prevent runaway agents

```http
PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/hitl-safety/budget/{project_id}/analyst
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "daily_token_limit": 1000,
  "session_token_limit": 500,
  "emergency_stop_enabled": true
}
```

**Expected Response**:

  "session_token_limit": 500,
  "tokens_used_today": 0,
  "tokens_used_session": 0,
  "emergency_stop_enabled": true
}
```

**Repeat for all agent types**: `analyst`, `architect`, `coder`, `tester`, `deployer`

---

## 4. Check Project Status

**Purpose**: Verify project was created

```http
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/status
```

**Expected Response**:
```json

    "current_task_id": null,
    "last_activity": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  }
  // ... other agents
}
```

---

## 6. Create Analyst Task (Implementation Plan - MANDATORY FIRST TASK)

**Purpose**: Start the workflow with implementation plan creation

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Every agent MUST create an Implementation Plan as their first task in each phase

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/tasks
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "agent_type": "analyst",
  "instructions": "Create a comprehensive implementation plan for the requirements analysis phase. This is the mandatory first task before any requirements gathering begins. Use the analyst-implementation-plan template to define approach, methodology, timeline, and success criteria.",

    "status": "PENDING",
    "estimated_tokens": 200,
    "estimated_cost": 0.002,
    "request_data": {
      "instructions": "Analyze requirements for a simple task management mobile app...",
      "estimated_tokens": 200,
      "context_ids": []
    },
    "expires_at": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:05:00Z"
  }
]
```

---

## 8. Approve Agent Execution (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Grant permission for agent to execute

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/hitl-safety/approve-agent-execution/{approval_id}
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "comment": "Approved for requirements analysis - budget looks reasonable"
}
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "approval_id": "approval-123",
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "message": "Agent execution approved. Task will now proceed.",
  "approved_at": "2024-01-15T10:06:00Z"
}
```

---

## 9. Monitor Task Progress

**Purpose**: Watch the task execution after approval

```http
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/status
```

Poll this endpoint every 5-10 seconds. Expected progression:

```json
{
  "project_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
      "agent_type": "analyst",
      "status": "waiting_for_hitl",  // Initially waiting for approval
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:05:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:06:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

After approval, status changes to: `pending` → `working` → `waiting_for_hitl` (response approval) → `completed`

---

## 10. Handle Agent Response Approval (MANDATORY)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tasks Stuck in "waiting_for_hitl"
- **Check**: Pending HITL approval requests
- **Action**: Approve or reject pending requests
- **Command**: `GET /api/v1/hitl-safety/approvals/project/{project_id}`

### HITL Requests Not Appearing
- **Check**: HITL safety service is running
- **Action**: Verify database has `hitl_agent_approvals` table
- **Command**: `GET /api/v1/hitl-safety/health`

### Budget Limits Exceeded
- **Check**: Current budget usage
- **Action**: Increase limits or reset counters
- **Command**: `GET /api/v1/hitl-safety/budget/{project_id}/{agent_type}`

### Agent Status Shows "error"
- **Check**: LLM provider API keys and quotas
- **Action**: Verify API configuration and rate limits
- **Command**: `GET /api/v1/agents/status/{agent_type}`

### Emergency Stop Active
- **Check**: Active emergency stops
- **Action**: Deactivate emergency stops if appropriate
- **Command**: `GET /api/v1/hitl-safety/emergency-stops`

---

## WebSocket Testing (Real-time Updates)

Connect to WebSocket for real-time HITL notifications:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/{project_id}');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Real-time update:', data);
  
  // Handle HITL approval requests
  if (data.event_type === 'HITL_REQUEST_CREATED') {
    console.log('New approval required:', data.data.approval_id);
  }
  
  // Handle emergency stops
  if (data.event_type === 'ERROR' && data.data.emergency_stop) {
    console.log('Emergency stop activated:', data.data.reason);
  }
};
```

---

## Implementation Status Summary

✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**:

1. **HITL Safety APIs**: All endpoints implemented and functional in `/api/v1/hitl-safety/`
2. **Budget Controls**: Full budget limit management with GET/PUT endpoints
3. **Emergency Stop System**: Complete emergency stop functionality with activation/deactivation
4. **Approval Workflow**: Comprehensive approval request and response handling
5. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for HITL events

⚠️ **ISSUES REQUIRING FIXES**:

1. **Database Schema**: Fix emergency_stops.active column type mismatch
2. **Agent Integration**: Verify agent task execution respects HITL controls
3. **Service Health**: Resolve HITL safety service degraded status
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for SQL type issues

---

## Summary

⏺ This comprehensive testing guide walks you through the complete happy path workflow for BotArmy with **mandatory HITL safety controls**. The sequence covers:

- System health verification with HITL status
- **Mandatory budget configuration** for all agents
- Project lifecycle management with safety controls
- **Multi-agent task orchestration with human approval**
- **Mandatory HITL interactions** for every agent action
- Artifact generation and download with approval tracking
- Emergency stop testing and recovery

**Key Points**:
- **HITL controls are MANDATORY** - agents cannot execute without human approval
- Configure budget limits before creating any tasks
- Each agent requires 2 approvals: pre-execution and response approval
- Monitor budget usage to prevent runaway costs
- Emergency stops can halt all agent activity immediately
- The workflow takes 15-35 minutes including manual approvals

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **Implementation mostly complete** - HITL APIs functional but service health degraded due to database schema issue
