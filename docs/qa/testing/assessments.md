### **QA Assessments: Verification & Validation Plan**

This document outlines a comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) plan for the BotArmy project. The assessments are designed to verify that the system functions as specified, meets its non-functional requirements, and that the end-to-end workflow is robust and reliable.

---

### **1. Functional QA Assessments**

These assessments are derived directly from the user stories and functional requirements. They are designed to test the core features of the system.

#### **Epic 1: Project Lifecycle & Orchestration**

* **Test Case: Project Initiation**
  * **Objective:** Verify a new project can be created and the first task is successfully initiated.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Navigate to the application.
        2. Enter a product idea in the chat and submit.
        3. Verify a `Project` record is created in the database.
        4. Verify the `Analyst` agent's first task is enqueued with the correct input.
        5. Verify the frontend displays a confirmation message.
* **Test Case: Real-time Status Updates**
  * **Objective:** Confirm the UI displays real-time agent status changes from the backend.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Start a new project.
        2. Monitor the `AgentStatusGrid` on the frontend.
        3. Verify the `Analyst` agent's status changes from `idle` to `working`.
        4. Verify the `Project` progress bar updates as the task progresses.
* **Test Case: Sequential Task Handoff**
  * **Objective:** Ensure the Orchestrator correctly passes tasks between agents.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Start a project and let the `Analyst` agent complete its task.
        2. Verify the Orchestrator's log shows it has identified the next agent (`Architect`).
        3. Verify a new task with a structured `HandoffSchema` is enqueued for the `Architect` agent.

### **2. Non-Functional QA Assessments**

These assessments are based on the non-functional requirements and focus on the system's performance, reliability, and security.

* **Test Case: Performance (NFR-01)**
  * **Objective:** Verify that real-time updates have minimal latency.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Use a WebSocket testing tool to connect to the `/ws` endpoint.
        2. Monitor the time between an event being logged on the backend and its arrival at the client.
        3. Verify the latency is consistently below 500ms.
* **Test Case: Reliability (NFR-03)**
  * **Objective:** Ensure the system can recover from a task failure.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Simulate a system crash or a task failure for an active agent.
        2. Restart the Orchestrator.
        3. Verify the Orchestrator detects the crashed task and re-enqueues it for retry based on the `Task State Persistence` story.
* **Test Case: Maintainability (NFR-04)**
  * **Objective:** Confirm the codebase adheres to SOLID principles.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Conduct a code review focusing on the SOLID principles.
        2. Verify the separation of concerns (SRP) in core classes.
        3. Verify the use of interfaces and abstractions (DIP) in the Orchestrator and data service layers.

### **3. Workflow & Process QA Assessments**

These tests validate the end-to-end process flow and the critical Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) checkpoints.

* **Test Case: End-to-End Workflow**
  * **Objective:** Execute a full project run from start to finish.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Initiate a project and let it proceed through all phases as defined in the `SDLC_Process_Flow`.
        2. Verify that all agent handoffs are successful and that the correct artifacts are generated at each stage.
        3. Verify the final output includes a functional POC and all required documentation.
* **Test Case: HITL Functionality**
  * **Objective:** Ensure the HITL system can pause, receive user input, and resume the workflow.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Initiate a project and let the `Analyst` agent complete its task.
        2. Verify the agent's status changes to `waiting_for_hitl`.
        3. On the frontend, approve the request.
        4. Verify the `HitlRequest` record is updated and the Orchestrator resumes the `Architect` agent's task.
        5. Repeat the test with the `amend` and `reject` actions, verifying the workflow behaves as expected for each.
* **Test Case: Bug Fix Loop**
  * **Objective:** Verify the system can automatically fix errors during the `Validate` phase.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Introduce a known bug into the code generated by the `Coder` agent.
        2. Run the `Tester` agent.
        3. Verify the `Tester` agent's output is an error report and the `Bug Fix` loop is triggered.
        4. Verify the `Coder` agent receives the error report and attempts to fix the bug.
        5. Verify the `Tester` re-runs its tests and reports a success.

### **4. Risk & Security QA Assessments**

These assessments directly test the effectiveness of the proposed risk mitigation strategies.

* **Test Case: Scope Creep Mitigation (ER-02)**
  * **Objective:** Confirm the `Discovery & Planning` phase effectively manages project scope.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Start a project with a vague product idea.
        2. During the initial HITL checkpoint, introduce a new, out-of-scope requirement.
        3. Verify the `Analyst` agent's output does not include the new requirement unless amended by the user and confirmed with a new HITL request.
* **Test Case: API Communication (TR-02)**
  * **Objective:** Verify the health check endpoint correctly reflects the system's status.
  * **Steps:**
        1. Access the `/healthz` endpoint.
        2. Verify the response shows `api_status`, `db_status`, and `celery_status` as `ok`.
        3. Simulate a database connection failure and re-check the `healthz` endpoint.
        4. Verify the `db_status` changes to an error state.
