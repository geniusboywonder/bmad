### **QA Gates: Project Phase Checkpoints**

This document defines the formal Quality Assurance (QA) gates for the BotArmy project. A QA gate is a mandatory checkpoint where a set of specific tests must pass before the project can transition from one phase of the SDLC to the next. This ensures quality is built in at every step of the process.

---

### **Gate 1: Plan Approval** ‚úÖ

**Objective:** To ensure the project plan is sound and the requirements are well-defined before any design or coding begins. This gate is cleared by the user via the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system.

* **Tests to Pass:**
  * **Test Case: Project Initiation**
  * **Test Case: HITL Functionality** (User approves the initial `project_plan.json` artifact)
  * **Test Case: Scope Creep Mitigation** (The user's approval confirms the agreed-upon scope)

### **Gate 2: Design Complete** üìê

**Objective:** To verify that the technical architecture and implementation plan are complete, robust, and free of logical flaws before code generation.

* **Tests to Pass:**
  * **Test Case: Sequential Task Handoff** (Verify the `Analyst` and `Architect` agent handoff is successful and the `implementation_plan.json` is generated.)
  * **Test Case: Maintainability** (Initial code review confirms adherence to SOLID principles in the Orchestrator and core services.)

### **Gate 3: Build Verified** üèóÔ∏è

**Objective:** To ensure the generated code is functional, well-tested, and ready for deployment. This is the most critical gate for the automated bug-fix loop.

* **Tests to Pass:**
  * **Test Case: Bug Fix Loop** (The `Tester` and `Coder` agents successfully find and fix a simulated bug.)
  * **Test Case: Real-time Status Updates** (All real-time status changes are correctly reflected in the UI during the build process.)

### **Gate 4: Validation & Release Candidate** üöÄ

**Objective:** To confirm the end-to-end workflow is stable and the system can handle failures gracefully. The project is a release candidate after this gate is cleared.

* **Tests to Pass:**
  * **Test Case: End-to-End Workflow** (A full project run from idea to final artifacts is successful.)
  * **Test Case: Reliability** (The system can recover from a simulated task crash without data loss.)
  * **Test Case: HITL Functionality** (The `amend` and `reject` actions are verified to function correctly and resume the workflow.)

### **Gate 5: Final Acceptance** üéâ

**Objective:** To ensure the deployed product meets its performance, security, and final delivery requirements. This is the final gate before the project is considered complete.

* **Tests to Pass:**
  * **Test Case: Final Artifact Generation** (All final documents and code are successfully generated and made available for download.)
  * **Test Case: Performance** (Real-time latency meets the NFR of < 500ms.)
  * **Test Case: API Communication** (The `/healthz` endpoint correctly reports the status of all services.)
