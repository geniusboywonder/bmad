# Autogen Dependency Issue

This document outlines the troubleshooting steps taken to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'` error encountered during Sprint 2 development.

## Problem Description

While implementing the Orchestrator service, which relies on the `autogen` framework, the application failed to start due to a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'`. This error persisted even after multiple attempts to install the required packages.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Initial Implementation:**
    *   Added `pyautogen==0.2.9` to `requirements.txt`.
    *   Added `import autogen` to `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py`.
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'`.

2.  **Dependency Installation:**
    *   The initial test run failed due to missing dependencies. I installed all the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` using `pip install`.
    *   The installation failed due to an error building `psycopg2-binary`. I replaced it with `psycopg[binary]`.
    *   The installation failed again due to an incompatible `pyautogen` version. I removed the version specifier to let pip choose the latest compatible version.
    *   The installation failed again due to an error building `pydantic-core`. I removed the version specifiers for `pydantic` and `pydantic-settings`.
    *   Finally, all dependencies were installed successfully.
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'` persisted.

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    *   The tests failed due to a `ValidationError` in the `Settings` class. I created a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the required environment variables.
    *   The tests still failed with the same error. I updated `app/config.py` to correctly load the `.env` file using an absolute path.
    *   The tests failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`. I updated the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file to use the `psycopg` dialect.
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'` persisted.

4.  **`autogen` Import and Installation:**
    *   I used the `context7` tools (`resolve_library_id` and `get_library_docs`) to get information about the `pyautogen` library. The documentation suggested that the main package is `autogen-agentchat`.
    *   I tried different import statements:
        *   `import autogen.agentchat as autogen`
        *   `from autogen import agentchat`
    *   I uninstalled and reinstalled `pyautogen` and `autogen-agentchat`.
    *   I tried to install a specific version of `pyautogen` (`0.5.7`) that was listed as compatible with Python 3.11.
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'` persisted in all cases.

5.  **PYTHONPATH Configuration:**
    *   I added the `backend` directory to the `pythonpath` in `pyproject.toml` to help pytest find the modules.
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'` persisted.

## Final Outcome

After exhausting all available troubleshooting steps, I was unable to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen'`. This suggests a deeper issue with the environment or the way the packages are installed that I am unable to diagnose.

As a result, all changes made during Sprint 2 have been reverted to their original state. It is recommended to investigate the Python environment and the installation of the `autogen` package to resolve this issue before proceeding with the implementation of the Orchestrator service.
