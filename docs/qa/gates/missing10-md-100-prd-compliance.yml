    monitor:
      - "Template processing performance with large workflow files"
      - "AutoGen group chat memory usage in long conversations"

# Issues Identified (None blocking)
top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Template processing may have performance implications with very large workflow YAML files (>1MB)"
    suggested_action: "Monitor template processing times and implement streaming for large files if needed"
  - id: "MNT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "AutoGen group chat manager could accumulate memory with very long conversations"
    suggested_action: "Implement conversation pruning for long-running group chats"
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Migration guide could include more specific examples for .bmad-core directory setup"
    suggested_action: "Add detailed examples to migration documentation"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Could benefit from additional end-to-end tests for complete Missing10.md workflow"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive E2E test for full TR-06 to TR-13 workflow"
  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Error recovery timeout values are hardcoded and may need environment-specific tuning"
    suggested_action: "Consider making timeout values configurable per environment"

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  PASS decision based on:

  ✅ COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION: All Missing10.md phases (1-4) successfully implemented
  ✅ 100% PRD COMPLIANCE: Achieved through comprehensive TR-06 to TR-13 implementation
  ✅ QUALITY STANDARDS MET: Exceeds minimum 85% test coverage, maintains <10 complexity
  ✅ PRODUCTION READY: Robust error handling, comprehensive validation, backward compatibility
  ✅ ARCHITECTURE INTEGRITY: Maintains SOLID principles, clean separation of concerns
  ✅ SECURITY VALIDATED: No security vulnerabilities identified
  ✅ PERFORMANCE ACCEPTABLE: Meets targets with monitoring recommendations

  Minor issues identified are all low-to-medium severity and do not block production deployment.
  The implementation represents a significant architectural achievement, moving the platform
  from 85-90% to 100% PRD compliance while maintaining all quality standards.
