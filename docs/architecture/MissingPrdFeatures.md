MISSING CORE FEATURES

  1. AutoGen Framework Integration

  - Gap: PRD requires full AutoGen framework integration (TR-06 to TR-08)
  - Current: Base AutoGen setup exists but conversation patterns and handoffs are incomplete
  - Missing: Group chat capabilities, structured handoff patterns, agent team configurations

  2. BMAD Core Template System

  - Gap: PRD specifies dynamic loading from .bmad-core/ directories (TR-10 to TR-13)
  - Current: Basic template service exists
  - Missing: YAML parsing, variable substitution, conditional logic, workflow definitions

  3. Multi-LLM Provider Support

  - Gap: PRD requires configurable multi-provider support (TR-01, TR-02)
  - Current: Only OpenAI integration implemented
  - Missing: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini providers, per-agent LLM mapping

  4. Database & Persistence Layer

  - Gap: PostgreSQL with proper indexing (TR-14 to TR-17)
  - Current: Models defined but no Alembic migrations or proper transactions
  - Missing: Database setup, migrations, connection pooling, Redis for Celery

  INCOMPLETE AGENT IMPLEMENTATIONS

  5. Agent Behavior Specifications (AB-01 to AB-30)

  - Current: Base agent framework with LLM reliability
  - Missing:
    - 6-phase SDLC workflow orchestration
    - Specific agent implementations (Analyst PRD generation, Architect tech specs)
    - Document generation using BMAD templates
    - Conflict resolution between agents

  6. Context Store & Mixed-Granularity Storage

  - Gap: Advanced artifact management (FR-50 to FR-54)
  - Current: Basic context artifact storage
  - Missing: Document/section/concept-level granularity, intelligent artifact selection

  HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP GAPS

  7. Enhanced HITL Triggers (HL-01 to HL-16)

  - Current: Basic approval framework exists
  - Missing:
    - Phase completion triggers
    - Confidence threshold triggers
    - Bulk approval operations
    - Configurable oversight levels

  8. Conflict Resolution Process

  - Gap: Automated mediation with human escalation (HL-13 to HL-16)
  - Current: No conflict detection
  - Missing: Agent reasoning comparison, structured conflict presentation

  REAL-TIME & ERROR HANDLING

  9. WebSocket Infrastructure Enhancement

  - Current: Basic WebSocket support
  - Missing:
    - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
    - Event delivery guarantees
    - Progress updates every 30 seconds
    - Session state preservation

  10. Comprehensive Error Recovery (EH-01 to EH-14)

  - Current: Basic retry logic in BaseAgent
  - Missing:
    - Orchestrator task reassignment
    - Workflow state preservation during recovery
    - Data corruption detection
    - Graceful degradation

  FRONTEND INTEGRATION

  11. Process Summary & Agent Status

  - Current: Mockup components exist
  - Missing: Real-time WebSocket integration with backend status

  12. Document Assembly & Export

  - Gap: Template-driven document generation (FR-46 to FR-49)
  - Current: Basic artifact display
  - Missing: Version control, multi-format export (PDF, HTML)

  DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE

  13. Celery Task Queue

  - Gap: Redis-backed task processing (TR-15)
  - Current: Celery configuration exists but no Redis setup
  - Missing: Worker processes, task monitoring, queue management

  14. Health Monitoring & Performance

  - Gap: API response time requirements (NFR-07 to NFR-11)
  - Current: Basic health endpoint
  - Missing: Performance metrics, concurrent project support validation

  IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

  Phase 1 (Critical Foundation):
  1. Database setup with PostgreSQL + Redis
  2. Multi-LLM provider configuration
  3. AutoGen conversation patterns
  4. BMAD core template loading

  Phase 2 (Core Workflows):
  1. 6-phase SDLC orchestration
  2. Agent-specific implementations
  3. Enhanced HITL triggers
  4. Context store improvements

  Phase 3 (Integration & Polish):
  1. Frontend-backend WebSocket integration
  2. Document assembly system
  3. Performance optimization
  4. Comprehensive error handling

  The codebase has solid foundations with advanced LLM reliability, HITL safety controls, and agent architecture, but
  needs the missing pieces above to meet the comprehensive PRD requirements.
