- Time limits and retry logic configured

**Issues Found**:
1. **Missing Alembic Migrations**: No migration files detected
2. **Missing Index Creation**: Performance indexes mentioned in Phase1and2.md not implemented
3. **Environment Configuration**: Currently using SQLite in `.env` instead of PostgreSQL

**Recommended Fixes**:
```sql
-- Missing indexes from Phase1and2.md requirements:
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_project_agent_status ON tasks(project_id, agent_type, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_context_artifacts_project_type ON context_artifacts(project_id, artifact_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_hitl_requests_project_status ON hitl_requests(project_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_executions_project_status ON workflow_executions(project_id, status);
```

#### ⚠️ P1.2 Multi-LLM Provider Configuration

**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ⚠️

**Current Implementation**:
- Basic provider abstraction exists in `/backend/app/services/llm_providers/`
- Provider factory pattern implemented
- Minimal provider classes for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini

**Critical Gaps**:
1. **Incomplete Provider Implementation**: Provider classes are stubs with minimal functionality
2. **Missing Agent-to-LLM Mapping**: No environment-based configuration system
3. **Missing Cost Tracking**: No provider-specific pricing models
4. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No provider-specific rate limits implemented

**Files Requiring Enhancement**:
- `/backend/app/services/llm_providers/anthropic_provider.py:1-17` - Only 17 lines, missing full Claude API integration
- `/backend/app/services/llm_providers/gemini_provider.py:1-25` - Only 25 lines, missing Vertex AI integration
- `/backend/app/config/agent_configs.py` - No agent-to-LLM mapping configuration

**Required Dependencies Missing**:
```python
# From requirements.txt analysis - these are present but not utilized:
anthropic>=0.25.0  # ✅ Available
google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.60.0  # ✅ Available
```

**Environment Configuration Gap**:
Current `.env` lacks agent-to-LLM mapping:
```bash
# MISSING from .env:
ANALYST_AGENT_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANALYST_AGENT_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
ARCHITECT_AGENT_PROVIDER=openai
ARCHITECT_AGENT_MODEL=gpt-4o

### Phase 2: Core Workflows

#### ❌ P2.1 6-Phase SDLC Orchestration

**Status**: CRITICAL GAP ❌

**Analysis**:
While workflow engine infrastructure exists in `/backend/app/services/workflow_engine.py`, the specific 6-phase SDLC implementation is **NOT IMPLEMENTED**.

**Missing Components**:
1. **No 6-Phase Workflow Definition**: The SDLC_PHASES configuration from Phase1and2.md is not implemented
2. **No Phase Transition Logic**: Discovery → Plan → Design → Build → Validate → Launch sequence missing
3. **No Phase Completion Validation**: Phase gates not implemented
4. **No Context Completeness System**: Selective context injection not working

**Orchestrator Service Issues**:
- `/backend/app/services/orchestrator.py:1-35` exists but lacks 6-phase logic
- No time-conscious orchestration features
- No front-loading of task details

**Critical Impact**: This is a core requirement that blocks the entire Phase 2 functionality.

#### ❌ P2.2 Agent-Specific Implementations

**Status**: BASIC IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY ❌

**Current State Analysis**:

**Analyst Agent** (`/backend/app/agents/analyst.py`):
- ✅ Basic structure exists
- ❌ No PRD generation using BMAD templates
- ❌ No completeness validation
- ❌ No HITL request generation for clarification

**Architect Agent** (`/backend/app/agents/architect.py`):
- ✅ Basic structure exists
- ❌ No technical architecture generation from templates
- ❌ No API specification generation
- ❌ No implementation planning logic

**Coder Agent** (`/backend/app/agents/coder.py`):
- ✅ Basic structure exists
- ❌ No production-ready code generation
- ❌ No test generation pipeline
- ❌ No code quality validation

**Tester Agent** (`/backend/app/agents/tester.py`):
- ✅ Basic structure exists

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Code Quality Issues
- Many agent implementations are stubs with TODO comments
- LLM provider classes lack error handling and retry logic
- Missing comprehensive test coverage for new features

### Architecture Issues
- Circular import potential in workflow engine
- Heavy coupling between services and database models
- Inconsistent error handling patterns

### Documentation Gaps
- Missing API documentation for new services
- No deployment guides for new database tables
- Insufficient code comments for complex workflow logic

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 & 2 implementation shows excellent progress in infrastructure and safety systems but has critical gaps in core functionality. The 6-phase SDLC orchestration must be implemented immediately to make the system functional for end users.

The advanced HITL safety features and database models exceed original requirements, providing a solid foundation for enterprise deployment. However, the basic agent implementations need significant enhancement to meet professional software development standards.

**Recommended Action**: Focus on implementing the 6-phase SDLC orchestration and completing multi-LLM provider integration before proceeding with Phase 3 features.
