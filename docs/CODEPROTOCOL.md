- **Always follow** the **Code Protocol** in `docs/CODEPROTOCOL.md`.
- **Always follow** the **Style Guide** in `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`
- Use the **README** to understand project context and structure.
- Use `https://github.com/geniusboywonder/v0-botarmy-poc` as the code base.
- Document all code changes and updates in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Document plans with detailed, **timestamped steps** in `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Track progress with **timestamped updates** in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

- **Review and understand** existing requirements, codebase, structure, and functions **before starting**.
- **Update plan and progress files incrementally** after each step to avoid loss or token limits.

## Planning

- **Break tasks into small, manageable steps**.
- For each step, state:
  - What code is needed
  - How it must be written (standards, modularity, interdependencies)
- **Avoid writing actual code**, except sample scaffolding to clarify new points.
- Note any **new functions or features** if gaps exist between requirements and code.

- Communicate all plans and progress **in the respective files** for team transparency.

- **Ask clarifying questions** before starting to remove ambiguity.
- **State all assumptions** clearly.
