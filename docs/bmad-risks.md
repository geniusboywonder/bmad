### **Project Risk Analysis & Mitigation**

---

### **1. Risk Categories**

We will categorize risks to better understand their nature and scope.

* **Technical Risks** üíª: Risks related to the technology stack, architecture, and implementation.
* **Execution Risks** üèÉ: Risks related to the project's management, timeline, and dependencies.
* **Operational Risks** ‚öôÔ∏è: Risks related to the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.

### **2. Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies**

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Impact (High/Medium/Low) | Probability (High/Medium/Low) | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TR-01** | The LLM-generated code contains significant errors or is not production-ready, requiring extensive manual refactoring. | Technical | High | Medium | Implement the **`Tester` agent** to automatically run unit tests on generated code and feed failures back to the `Coder` agent. The `SDLC_Process_Flow` now includes a `Bug Fix` loop to handle this. |
| **TR-02** | The API communication between microservices (FastAPI, Celery, etc.) is unstable or fails, causing data loss. | Technical | High | Low | Use **strict API contracts** with Pydantic for validation. Implement an idempotent task queue to handle retries. The `Backend: Deep Dive & API Contract` specifies a `Healthz` endpoint to actively monitor the status of all services. |
| **TR-03** | Integrating the chosen agent framework (AutoGen) with our custom backend proves more complex than anticipated. | Technical | Medium | High | Adhere to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** by programming to interfaces. The Orchestrator will depend on agent abstractions, allowing us to easily swap out or mock the agent framework during development. |
| **ER-01** | The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) system becomes a bottleneck if the user is not consistently available to respond. | Execution | High | High | Design the system to handle asynchronous responses. The `HitlRequest` model includes `pending` and `waiting_for_hitl` statuses, allowing agents to pause and wait without blocking the system. The frontend will clearly indicate when a HITL response is required. |
| **ER-02** | The project scope (especially for the POC) expands, leading to "scope creep" and missed deadlines. | Execution | Medium | Medium | The revised `SDLC_Process_Flow` now includes a **"Discovery & Planning"** phase with a critical HITL checkpoint. This forces early alignment on the project's scope, and the generated `project_plan.json` serves as the official scope document for the project. |
| **OR-01** | The system runs into high cloud infrastructure costs due to resource-intensive LLM and agent tasks. | Operational | Medium | Low | We will implement a monitoring system to track resource usage and costs. The task queue can be configured to manage concurrency and ensure resource usage stays within a defined budget. We can also explore using a cost-effective LLM provider for initial testing. |

### **3. Risk Management Plan**

* **Continuous Monitoring:** We will regularly review and update this risk document throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Communication:** Any new risks identified will be immediately communicated to all stakeholders.
* **Contingency Plan:** For each high-impact risk, a contingency plan will be prepared in advance. For example, if the LLM code quality is consistently poor, the contingency plan may involve using a different LLM or dedicating more developer time to manual code review.
