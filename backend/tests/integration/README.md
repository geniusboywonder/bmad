  - Enterprise governance frameworks

## Usage

### Running All Tests

```bash
cd backend
python test_adk_enterprise_integration.py
```

### Running Individual Test Modules

```bash
# HITL Integration
python tests/integration/test_hitl_integration.py

# Context Store Integration
python tests/integration/test_context_store_integration.py

# WebSocket Integration
python tests/integration/test_websocket_integration.py

# Audit Trail Integration
python tests/integration/test_audit_trail_integration.py

# Security Integration
python tests/integration/test_security_integration.py

# Performance & Load Testing
python tests/integration/test_performance_load.py

# Compliance Validation
python tests/integration/test_compliance_validation.py
```

## Test Results Structure

Each test module returns a standardized result dictionary:

```python
{
    "success": bool,                    # Overall test success
    "test_type": str,                   # Type of test performed
    "error": str,                       # Error message if failed
    # ... module-specific metrics
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up test environment
export BMAD_TEST_MODE=true
export ADK_INTEGRATION_TEST=true
```

### Test Configuration

Each test module can be configured via environment variables:

- `ADK_MODEL`: LLM model to use for testing
- `TEST_CONCURRENCY`: Number of concurrent operations
- `ENTERPRISE_COMPLIANCE_LEVEL`: Compliance validation strictness

## Reporting and Monitoring
